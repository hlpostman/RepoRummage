# Lab 3 - *RepoRummage*

**Repo Rummage** is a GitHub Repo search app using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories).

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Customize cell selection style
- [x] Custom Github logo search bar icon

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Fun search bar customizations
2. Opinions on cell separator line styling

## Notes

Reading the Apple documentation on search bars was good.  I wasnâ€™t sure if it was possible to put in a custom icon to replace the magnifying glass, so that was cool.
